      <description>Intro Nowadays smartphones are basically a pocket computers. Smartphone hardware evolution is very rapid. I was in a situation where my middle-tier phone was better than my current laptop. Could smartphone be used for programming in that case? The answer is yes but is it actual feasible? In this post we&amp;rsquo;ll focus on implementing a blog on a Android smartphone.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been using my smartphone to play with C++, Go, Vim and practice UNIX programs like AWK and grep for quite some time now.</description>

      <title>I&#39;m quitting cmd</title>

      <description>Background Regarding operating systems I prefer Linux over Windows. Even though in my job I&#39;m forced to use Windows. To make my work on Windows more pleasant I&#39;ve been using Command-line alongside with vim, grep, AWK and other Unix/Linux tools.
Using cmd before Windows 10 was not a very visual appealing experience. It suppose to be just a rectangle box with a text and somehow they made it hard to read and write text.</description>

      <title>Vim Movement Challenge</title>

      <description>I&#39;ve been using Vim for about 3 years now and I feel very comfortable using it. But recently I&#39;ve got feeling that for a long time I didn&#39;t make any progress regarding my movement in Vim. In those years w\W, b\B, e\E, t, f, /, ?, $, ^, 0, } and G were my best friends for making fast and precise moves in normal mode. Don&#39;t get me wrong. With those I&#39;m happy and still can finish editing much more quicker than in standard text editor.</description>

      <description>Intro I want to share with you a list of my favorite tech talks. I can honestly say this is my hobby. Watching tech talks on YouTube. Here I&#39;ve prepared list of eleven my most liked presentations. For each of them I try to describe why those are special to me and why their are worth watching. Order of titles is not particularly important.
I wanted to keep this list pretty short (around 10) therefore it&#39;s not complete.</description>

      <description>Intro While building most of projects or apps it is very common to read from a database. In go standard way to do that is by using database/sql standard library. To illustrate how it can be done let&#39;s load from database a bunch of Points which are slice of Points defined as follows
 type Point struct { X int Y float64 } type Points []Point  Next listening contains definition of function ReadPoints which for existing *sql.</description>

      <description>Intro For few years when I was practicing data science I&#39;ve used quantiles a lot. I knew what it is and when one should use it. I knew mathematical definition and intuition around quantiles but if someone would ask me to implement it from scratch I wouldn&#39;t know how to do it right away.
So what is a quantile? It&#39;s a one of most commonly used descriptive statistic. It gives us aggregated information about sample&#39;s distribution.</description>

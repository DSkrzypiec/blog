      <description>Intro Time flies! It&amp;rsquo;s time to summarize the year 2024. For additional context you might want to check the summary of 2023.
Running paused The beginning of 2024 (January, February) was a period of intense running training in preparation for the Warsaw Half Marathon. I intended to achieve a time below 2 hours (around 1:50) in this race. Unfortunately, at the beginning of March, pain around the knee and tension in the quadriceps muscle prevented further training.</description>

      <description>Continuation of 2022 I would like to start by mentioning the things I continued doing in 2023, beginning with sports. I maintained my running routine, pursued table tennis training, and practiced fundamental calisthenics, including pull-ups, push-ups, and dips. However, I decided to discontinue my Russian language studies, mostly due to lack of time. As for my MacBook Air M1 from 2020, it&amp;rsquo;s still in pretty decent condition, even after nearly three years of heavy usage.</description>

      <description>Continuation of 2021 highlights As the first highlight of year 2022 I wanted to mention the continuation of most of habits that I&amp;rsquo;ve started in 2021. I&amp;rsquo;m still jog regularly. I tried to learn Russian somehow regularly over the year. I had some breaks but generally I learned a bit and didn&amp;rsquo;t forget what I&amp;rsquo;ve learned in 2021. I still do pull ups and chin ups on daily basis. I&amp;rsquo;ve run three (3km, 6km and 6km) Runmageddons in 2022!</description>

      <description>Started jogging In January, after a long pandemic home isolation I&amp;rsquo;ve started jogging. For my whole life I always hate jogging. I love most sports but running was something else. After almost a year in pandemic with gyms being closed and almost no going outside I though that I&amp;rsquo;ll give it a try.
At first two tries I couldn&amp;rsquo;t run 500 meters without a break for catching a breath. Unexpectedly body adaptation was very quick!</description>

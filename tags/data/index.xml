      <description>Intro Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve visited very interesting website which presents byte by byte what happens when website (data) is sent using TLS. One thing is to know roughly how TLS works and another one is to actually see with explanations what is really happening. Under its influence I thought that I&amp;rsquo;ve been working with parquet files for some time but I don&amp;rsquo;t really know their structure. I know its properties, how and when one should use it but I have never really experienced what parquet format really is.</description>

      <description>Intro Almost five years passed since last time I&amp;rsquo;ve extensively used data frame library to calculate things. I sort of switched from analyzing data and building application around that to more &amp;ldquo;regular&amp;rdquo; programming and data engineering. I sometimes still use data.table in R or pandas in Python for ad-hoc analysis but nowadays I rarely need to do it. For completeness I should add that data frame library is a software library that support operations on data frames which are some kind of tables, usually kept in memory used for data analysis.</description>

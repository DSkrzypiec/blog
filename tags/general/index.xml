      <description>The News I&amp;rsquo;m happy to announce that the first ppacer release is out! That is literally version v0.0.1. Please check the GitHub release to get the full list of features and changes: v0.0.1 on GitHub.
Is It Ready Then? Of course it is not. Version v0.0.1 was focused on making the backend stable enough and with a minimal set of features to be used by users, including myself. To be clear, there is no frontend yet.</description>

      <description>Intro As I mentioned in New Scheduler, in the second half of 2023 I started working on implementing new scheduler in Go. In this post I wanted to share with you the current status of the project, next steps and few links.
The name: ppacer At the end of the previous year I was already working already for 4-5 months on this project but still I didn&amp;rsquo;t have a name for it.</description>

      <title>New Scheduler</title>

      <description>Intro I&amp;rsquo;ve started implementing yet another DAG scheduler, something like Airflow or Luigi. This post is going to be on why I&amp;rsquo;m doing this and what I&amp;rsquo;m trying to achieve.
Before we start, let me do a short introduction to schedulers, in case you&amp;rsquo;ve never heard about it or use it yourself. What in here I&amp;rsquo;m calling scheduler is a program or software system which is responsible for scheduling execution of tasks or another programs in particular order.</description>

      <description>Intro Foundations are important whatever you do. That was said by many. So why I&amp;rsquo;m writing about that? It&amp;rsquo;s because I&amp;rsquo;m worried about foundations situation in IT world.
Foundations are by definition important, because all things built in given space dependents on it. I&amp;rsquo;ll try to describe why that matters in examples of fields that I&amp;rsquo;m interested in.
I&amp;rsquo;ll say it at least twice - there is no shame to back to basics even on senior level of experience.</description>

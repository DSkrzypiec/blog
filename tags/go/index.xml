      <description>Intro Nowadays smartphones are basically a pocket computers. Smartphone hardware evolution is very rapid. I was in a situation where my middle-tier phone was better than my current laptop. Could smartphone be used for programming in that case? The answer is yes but is it actual feasible? In this post we&amp;rsquo;ll focus on implementing a blog on a Android smartphone.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been using my smartphone to play with C++, Go, Vim and practice UNIX programs like AWK and grep for quite some time now.</description>

      <description>Intro For few years when I was practicing data science I&#39;ve used quantiles a lot. I knew what it is and when one should use it. I knew mathematical definition and intuition around quantiles but if someone would ask me to implement it from scratch I wouldn&#39;t know how to do it right away.

      <description>Intro After six and a half (6.5) years I&amp;rsquo;m leaving PwC. In this post I wanted to shortly described my history in PwC and perhaps expose what it&amp;rsquo;s like to work in consulting.
All of the following are my recollections and my thoughts about working in PwC. On the publish date I&amp;rsquo;m no longer PwC employee. All opinions are my own and does not represent PwC in any way. Furthermore the following is very local focused.</description>

      <description>Intro Last Saturday, 17th October 2020, Całka (one of my two cats) had to be put to sleep. Name Całka translates from Polish to English as Integral. I and my (at that time) girlfriend were maths undergrads when we&amp;rsquo;ve taken Całka from an animal shelter in early 2016. That probably explains the name.
For the last two months, Całka fought with really nasty jaw bone cancer. It was growing fast. It was too big to even consider surgery.</description>

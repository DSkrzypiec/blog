      <title>Fuzzy Finder</title>

      <description>Intro I&amp;rsquo;ll start by stating that I don&amp;rsquo;t like fuzziness. It&amp;rsquo;s the main reason I didn&amp;rsquo;t stick to machine learning and data science at the beginning of my career. Instead I&amp;rsquo;ve transitioned to programming and data engineering.
And here I am writing about fuzzy finder in Vim. That&amp;rsquo;s because of fzf.vim Vim package. It has some very convenient feature that I have been looking for. More on this later in the post.</description>

      <description>Intro I wanted to share with you my experience with Vim sessions. The concept and usage are really simple but I didn&amp;rsquo;t know about it for a long time using Vim. In a nutshell you can save current state of your Vim environment as a session. Once it&amp;rsquo;s saved it can be reopened.
Have you ever been debugging (not necessarily in Vim) for few hours with bunch of files opened in particular order to wrap your head around the problem?</description>

      <title>Vim Movement Challenge</title>

      <description>I&#39;ve been using Vim for about 3 years now and I feel very comfortable using it. But recently I&#39;ve got feeling that for a long time I didn&#39;t make any progress regarding my movement in Vim. In those years w\W, b\B, e\E, t, f, /, ?, $, ^, 0, } and G were my best friends for making fast and precise moves in normal mode. Don&#39;t get me wrong. With those I&#39;m happy and still can finish editing much more quicker than in standard text editor.</description>
